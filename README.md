# ✉️ Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using a **Logistic Regression** model. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify email messages as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. The text data is transformed using **TF-IDF vectorization**, and the model is trained on a labeled dataset of 5,500+ emails.

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Null value handling
  - Label encoding (`spam = 0`, `ham = 1`)
  - Lowercasing, stopword removal
- **Train-Test Split**: 80:20

## 📊 Results

| Dataset       | Accuracy     |
|---------------|--------------|
| Training Set  | 96.76%       |
| Test Set      | 96.66%       |

- Model shows excellent generalization on unseen data.
- Successfully predicts spam/ham classification on custom inputs.
